# 100-days-of-code-with-python-

Welcome to my "100 Days of Coding with Python" journey! This repository contains my daily challenges, projects, and solutions as I work through 100 consecutive days of Python programming. Each day, I'll be learning something new, solving problems, and working on mini-projects to improve my Python skills.

About
This project is a personal commitment to dedicate time each day to improving my Python programming skills. I will be completing coding challenges, tutorials, building mini-projects, and much more. Each day I will document what I’ve learned and solved in the corresponding file or folder.

Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:

Strengthen problem-solving skills.
Learn new Python libraries and frameworks.
Build and complete small Python projects.
Develop a habit of consistent coding.
By the end of 100 days, I aim to have:

A deeper understanding of Python.
A portfolio of practical projects.
Improved coding discipline and problem-solving ability.
How to Contribute
While this project is mainly for personal growth, feel free to explore the challenges and projects. If you'd like to contribute, here’s how you can do so:

Fork the repository and create a branch for the day you want to work on.
Solve a coding challenge or contribute to a project on that day.
Create a Pull Request to merge your changes into the main branch.
Add a description of what you worked on that day.
Daily Log
Each day has a dedicated folder or file that contains the solutions, explanations, and progress for that particular day. You can follow my journey by going through the logs for each day.

Here’s an example structure:

Each folder includes:

README.md: Describes the challenge or project for the day.
problem_solution.py: Python solution or project code.
notes.md: A brief overview of what was learned, challenges faced, and insights gained.
Tools and Libraries
Throughout this project, I will explore and use different tools, libraries, and frameworks. Some of the common ones include:

Standard Python libraries: os, sys, math, random, etc.
Third-party libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, requests, flask, django, and others.
Version control: Git for tracking changes and GitHub for hosting the project.
You will find dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file when applicable.
